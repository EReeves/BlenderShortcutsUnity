Blender Shortcuts for Unity

Only works in Windows because Unity sucks.
Once imported restart unity for the key binds to apply.

--------------------------------------

Binds:

Shift = Pan
Rotate = R
Scale = S
Transform/Move = G
Delete = X
Shift+D = Duplicate

I'll probably add more in the future.

--------------------------------------

Unity hotkeys moved to fit blender ones:

Default Pan is now Shift+Q instead of Q
Pivot Rotation is now Ctrl+X instead of X
